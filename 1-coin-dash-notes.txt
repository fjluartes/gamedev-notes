COIN DASH
- Game 1 of Godot 4 book
- Collect coins before time runs out

NOTES
Setting up New Project
- Project > Project Settings
- Viewport height/width: 720x480 (portrait)
- Stretch - Mode - canvas_items, Aspect - Keep

PLAYER SCENE
- Display character w/ animations
- Respond to usesr input
- Detect collision
- Area2D
	- AnimatedSprite2D
	- CollisionShape2D
- "Area2D" Node
	- 2D node, can move in 2D space, can detect overlap with other nodes
- Click "Group Selected Node" icon to avoid accidental changes in node
- "AnimatedSprite2D" node
	- Handles appearance and animations
	- Animations - 5 to 8 FPS, Autoplay on Load for default sprite animation
	- Transform > Scale to change size
	- Use "Offset" property to center AnimatedSprite2D. Sprite images are not centered vertically.
- CollisionShape2D
	- "Hitbox" of the sprite i.e. shape of the sprite for collision
	- RectangleShape2D, CapsuleShape2D, etc.
- Scripting the player
	- Click Scripting icon to add scripts (GDScript) to Player scene.
	- Using @export annotation on "speed" variable allows setting the value in Inspector window.
- Moving the player
	- Use _process() function to define player movement
	- _process() function is called on every frame
	- Player does 3 things:
		- Check keyboard input
		- Move in given direction
		- Play animation
	- Project Settings > Input Map, Input.is_action_pressed()
	- Input.get_vector() - handles input in 4 directions
	- Clamp() - set min and max positions to prevent objects from leaving the screen
- Delta
	- Elapsed time since previous frame
	- Game engine runs at 60 FPS (frames per second)
	- If frame rate is not consistent, it affects object movement in game
	- ~16ms. e.g. 600 pixels/sec * delta = 10 pixels movement
- Choosing animations
	- If velocity > 0 - run, else idle
		- flip_h - flip sprite when moving to the left
- Starting/ending player movement
	- Main scene informs player when game has started or ended
	- start() and die() functions. 
	- set_process(bool) - starts or stops the _process() function
- Signals
	- Way for nodes to send out messages that other nodes can detect/react
	- e.g. body colliding, button being pressed, etc.
	- signal pickup
	- signal hurt
		- Signals that player will emit when they touch a coin or obstacle
	- area_entered
		- signal to detect collision
		- other nodes will also be Area2D nodes
		- creates _on_area_entered(area) function

COIN SCENE
Scene > New Scene
- Area2D
	- AnimatedSprite2D
	- CollisionShape2D
- Animation Speed - 12FPS
- Scale: (0.4, 0.4)
- CollisionShape2D - CircleShape2D
- Groups
	- group similar nodes
- queue_free()
	- Godot's method for removing nodes
	- Adds object to a queue to be deleted at end of frame

MAIN SCENE
Scene > New Scene
- Background - TextureRect
	- grass.png, Stretch Mode - tile, Full rect size
- GameTimer - Timer node
- Script
	- @export var coin_scene, playtime
	- @export allows variables to appear in Inspector tab
	- get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size
	- $Player - call player scene in main
		- add player as child scene: Main > Instantiate Child Scene > select player.tscn
- Starting a new game
	- new_game()
		- $Player.start(), $Player.show(), $GameTimer.start(), spawn_coins()
		- add new_game() to _ready() to test
	- spawn_coins()
		- spawn coin scene in random positions
		- c = coin_scene.instantiate()
		- add_child(c)
		- c.position, randi_range(0, screensize.x) & screensize.y

USER INTERFACE
